From a few years to now, it has had a enourmous growth of Version Control tools. It has become in an indispensable tool in the software development methodologies and all the teaching institutions know that incorporing them to their education systems is fundamental to providing a quality service.
\bigskip

This is what is intended with the developed tool after the completion of this Master's Degree Final Project: that it would be deployed at University of La Laguna basing on the premise that, currently, the development of a software project without using a version control system, is not viable. 
\bigskip

The automation of cloning and execution tasks would facilitate, in first instance, the students' projects correction. The amount of saved time per the teacher is considarable, keeping in mind the large amount of practices of each student per subject. This huge teacher's workload could be use in another academic scopes.
\bigskip

By the other hand, this tool set the bases to future improvements, like enlarge their own functionalities. It has been developed thinking about the scalability and, as it has all the structure created (user's authentication, cloning, execution and reporting), it's possible to add improvements without too effort.
\newpage

In conclusion, we can affirm that all the goals established at the beggining of the subject have been fulfilled and the next development guidelines could be:


\begin{itemize}
	\item Create scripts in \verb|Bash| to evaluate applications (installation of dependencies, code quality check and running tests) in several programming languages: \verb|Node.js|, \verb|C++|, \verb|Ruby|, \verb|Python|, etc.
	\bigskip
	
	This collections of scripts may be incorporated in the tool distribution or be supplied as standalone's applications which facilitate the use of \verb|ghshell|.
	
	\item Provide support to execute scripts written in anothers programming languages: Ruby, Python...
	\item Create {\it issues} in repositories with the results of scripts' executions.
	\item Create branches in repositories with the results of scripts' executions.
\end{itemize}
